# Zermelos-navigation-problem
Implementation of a Semi-Lagrangian numerical scheme for solving a evolutionary 2-Dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation whose viscosity solution is the value function of a finite horizon problem for the controlled dynamics of a swimmer immersed in a drift field. The objective is to take the swimmer to a given target set within the domain.
